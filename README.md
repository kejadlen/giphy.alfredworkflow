# Giphy.alfredworkflow

A workflow for [Alfred][alfred] that searches [Giphy][giphy] for animated gifs.
Actioning on a search item will preview the gif using Quick Look and [~~copy the direct URL of the GIF~~][older] the animated GIF to the clipboard.

## This is a fork of the [Giphy workflow][older] by Alpha Chen

This fork uses a small swift script to download the image data and place it into the NSPasteboard
