# Giphy**Paste**.alfredworkflow

A workflow for [Alfred][alfred] that searches [Giphy][giphy] for animated gifs.
Actioning on a search item will preview the gif using Quick Look and [~~copy the direct URL of the GIF~~][older] *the animated GIF* to the clipboard.

This fork uses a small swift script to download the image data and place it into the NSPasteboard
